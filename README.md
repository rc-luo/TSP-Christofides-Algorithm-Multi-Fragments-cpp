This repository contains implementations of some searching heuristics and approximation algorithms for the traveling salesman problem (TSP). 



Already implemented: 

- Baseline ($2$-approximation)
- Christofides ($3/2$-approximation)
- Multi-Fragments (MF)

Todo:

- Lin–Kernighan (LK)
- Stem-and-Cycle (S&C) Ejection Chain



Usage:

​	The source codes are written in c++. It has been tested and run on UNIX-type machines.
